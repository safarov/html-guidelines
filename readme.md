# About

## Installation 

Install grunt to system path:  

    npm install grunt -g

    cd build/
    npm install

## Usage

First of all go to build directory:  

    cd build/

Now you can use these commands:

`grunt watch` — same as previous but with autupdate of generated files on change.
`grunt publish` - full config run with css/js minification and image cleaning.
